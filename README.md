# CUDormReviews!
Our project is a website called CUDormReviews (inspired by CUReviews) that lets users submit and view reviews for all of the different dorms of Cornell. When you enter the site, there is a homepage with a background image, a search bar to search for the dorm you are looking for, a list of all the dorms (with clickable links for each that take you to a unique page about the dorm), and a section with filters to search by. When you search for a specific dorm or edit one of the filters, the list will change to only display dorms that match your search and filter criteria. 
On the dorm-specific pages, there is some general information including whether the dorm has AC/elevators/a dining hall, its size, and single, double, triple, and quad availability, and also some review-based information. The review-based information displayed is the average rating given by users for several categories, including social life, convenience, cleanliness, noise, lounges, and quality/appearance. There also are a list of individual user reviews displayed. In addition, there is a space to leave your own review. When the user is signed in, they can delete any of their reviews they previously creted.  One possible additional feature the site might include is an option to directly compare two dorms side-by-side.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
